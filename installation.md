# Installation

### NPM

You can install it via [NPM](http://npmjs.org/).

```
$ npm install --save vue-form-generator
```

### Manual

Download zip package, unpack and add the `vfg.css` and `vfg.js` file to your project from `/dist` folder.

```
https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator/releases/latest
```

### Import into Project

```js
<script>
    import Vue from 'vue';
    import VueFormGenerator from 'vue-form-generator'
    import 'vue-form-generator/dist/vfg.css'
    Vue.use(VueFormGenerator)
</script>
```


### Core vs Full version

VueFormGenerator can be setup using the 'core' or 'full' variations.
* Core is a minimal version with only half the fields.  
* Full is core + other fields.

If you don't know what to choose, don't worry, full is the default version.
If you want the slimmed down version, here are the changes:

```js
// "core" only
<script>
    import Vue from 'vue'
    import VueFormGenerator from 'vue-form-generator/dist/vfg-core.js'
    import 'vue-form-generator/dist/vfg-core.css'
    Vue.use(VueFormGenerator)
</script>
```

### Dependencies

VueFormGenerator uses [fecha](https://github.com/taylorhakes/fecha) and [lodash](https://lodash.com/) internally.

While core fields don't require external dependencies, optional fields in the full package may need additional libraries.  
These dependencies fall into two camps: jQuery or Vanilla. You can find almost the same functionality in both flavors.
That way, it's your choice to depend on jQuery or not.

| Field type | jQuery | Vanilla |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Address autocomplete | N/A | [googleAddress](fields/googleaddress.md) |
| Color picker | [spectrum](fields/spectrum.md) | N/A |
| Date picker | [datetime](fields/datetime.md) | [pikaday](fields/pikaday.md) |
| Masked Input | [masked](fields/masked.md) | [cleave](fields/cleave.md) |
| Multi Selection | [selectEx](fields/selectex.md) | [vueMultiSelect](fields/vuemultiselect.md) |
| Slider | [slider](fields/slider.md) | [noUiSlider](fields/nouislider.md) |

You can find details about dependencies in each field page.
